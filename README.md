# Etch-a-Sketch

This project is an Etch-a-sketch that utilizes DOM within javascript. To use this program, you can draw on the grid using any color from the color picker. You can also change the size of the grid by entering you desired size (max 100). This project consist of CSS, HTML, and Javascript. During this project I learned how to use the event listener and worked on my DOM skills.
